# StrokePredictionApp




This API uses a public dataset from the World Health Organization.

An efficient technique of over + undersampling applied to the whole dataset in order to compensate imbalance of strokes vs no strokes. 
First, negative stroke cases were reduced, then positive stroke cases were added. 


The selected model is Logistic Regression algorithm from sklearn library.


The purpose is to create a tool that can estimate the rist of having a stroke and the percentage of certitude.
